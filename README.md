[![Pretendo network logo](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/website/raw/master/public/assets/images/opengraph/opengraph-image.png)](https://pretendo.network)

Nimble is an Aroma setup module that patches the Nintendo Network BOSS policy list URLs on a Wii U to use [Pretendo Network](https://pretendo.network) instead. This policy list is used to control various system functions, most notably Wara Wara Plaza. *This will **not** do any patches besides the BOSS policy list*. To connect to the rest of Pretendo Network, see [Inkay](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Inkay)

## Nintendo Network

Nimble's patches are all temporary, and only applied in-memory without modifying your console. If you experience issues connecting to Nintendo Network while using Nimble, hold the `ZL` button on your control while booting your console to skip the patches

## TODO
